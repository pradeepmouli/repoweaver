# Specification Quality Checklist: Primary Source Configuration

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-10-20
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

**Notes**: The spec includes an informative "Configuration Schema Design" section that contains implementation hints (JSON structure, CLI examples) for planning reference. This is clearly marked as informative and serves planning purposes, not as implementation requirements. All actual requirements remain technology-agnostic.

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

**Notes**: All requirements are clear and testable. The informative configuration examples support planning without constraining implementation.

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

**Notes**: Three user stories (P1, P2, P3) provide independent, testable slices. P1 alone delivers MVP value. Success criteria are measurable and user-focused.

## Validation Results

**Status**: âœ… PASSED - All checklist items satisfied

**Summary**:

- 13 functional requirements defined (FR-001 through FR-013)
- 3 prioritized user stories with independent test scenarios
- 6 success criteria covering time, accuracy, and user experience
- 5 edge cases identified with clear handling expectations
- Dependencies and assumptions documented
- Out of scope items clearly defined

**Ready for next phase**: YES - Can proceed to `/speckit.clarify` or `/speckit.plan`

## Notes

The specification successfully balances:

1. **User-focused language**: Describes what users want to achieve, not how system implements it
2. **Technical clarity**: Provides enough detail for planning without prescribing implementation
3. **Testability**: Every requirement and user story can be independently verified
4. **Measurability**: Success criteria define concrete, verifiable outcomes

The informative "Configuration Schema Design" section appropriately previews potential implementation approaches while maintaining requirement technology-agnosticism.
