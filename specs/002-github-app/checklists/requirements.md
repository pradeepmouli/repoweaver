# Specification Quality Checklist: GitHub App for RepoWeaver

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-10-27
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

**Notes**: The spec focuses on WHAT users need (OAuth flow, web UI, webhooks, PR creation) without specifying HOW (no mention of specific frameworks, databases, or implementation approaches). All sections are complete and written for stakeholders.

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

**Notes**: All requirements are clear and testable. Success criteria use measurable metrics (time limits, percentages) without implementation specifics. Edge cases cover permission issues, webhooks, rate limits, and error scenarios. Out of scope section clearly defines boundaries.

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

**Notes**: Four prioritized user stories (P1-P4) provide independent, testable slices. P1 alone delivers MVP value (installation and connection). Each story has detailed acceptance scenarios. Success criteria are measurable and user-focused.

## Validation Results

**Status**: âœ… PASSED - All checklist items satisfied

**Summary**:
- 20 functional requirements defined (FR-001 through FR-020)
- 4 prioritized user stories with independent test scenarios
- 8 success criteria covering time, performance, and user experience
- 7 edge cases identified with clear handling expectations
- Dependencies and assumptions documented
- Out of scope items clearly defined

**Ready for next phase**: YES - Can proceed to `/speckit.clarify` or `/speckit.plan`

## Notes

The specification successfully balances:
1. **User-focused language**: Describes what users want to achieve (install app, configure templates, receive auto-updates) without technical implementation
2. **Technical clarity**: Provides enough detail for planning (OAuth flow, webhooks, permissions) without prescribing technology choices
3. **Testability**: Every requirement and user story can be independently verified
4. **Measurability**: Success criteria define concrete, verifiable outcomes (3 minutes to install, 2 seconds to load, 95% webhook success rate)
